### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tom!
<div>
* I'm a graduate of the School of Code (www.schoolofcode.co.uk)

After a varied career including several years in the French Alps working in the ski industry I was ready for a new challenge. Upon returning to the UK I seized the opportunity to join the School of Code bootcamp. This was a 16 week, immersive full-time full-stack software engineering bootcamp. I am now looking for my first full-time role as a software developer :)

I really enjoy software development for its unique combination of technical and creative aspects. I love working collaboratively in an environment of constant growth so Tech is perfect with its constantly growing and changing environment. There are new things to learn all the time and I want to be part of shaping the future through technology!
